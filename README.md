BYI or if u INT:

I'm nice and I like to Interact! You can int anytime! It's ok if ur shy too. I sometimes make weird jokes but I don't really do that anymore, I ask if they're comfortable with it too. If u need some space you can tell me and i will give u space ! I'm sometimes tired and i like to talk with exclamation marks and I can be annoying like abit so PLS TELL ME IF UR ANNOYED/UNCOMFORTABLE because I'll stop! When I'm looking for chat I want to interact and sometimes I get bored at being alone, I kinda get nervous too when I talk so nicely interact with me.
